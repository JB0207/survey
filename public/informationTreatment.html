    The world map illustrates whether the climate actions initiated by governments are meeting the globally agreed aim of the Paris Climate Agreement to keep global warming well below 2°C and to continue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C. 
    Assessments are adjusted on an ongoing basis using the factors of policies and measures, domestic target, fair share target (assessing whether countries are mutually supportive and whether developed countries are taking the lead in achieving global mitigation targets) and climate finance in the context of the greenhouse gas emissions of the respectie country.
    <br>
    As can be seen on the map, none of the countries shown, which emit 85% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, have taken sufficient action to meet the climate targets of the Paris Climate Agreement.

    The 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report projects global warming of <b>3°C</b> by 2100, and the Climate Action Tracker calculation projects warming of <b>2.7°C</b> by 2100, with currently adopted climate change mitigation measures.

    The graphic below shows the consequences that would occur with a global warming of 1.5°C or 2°C.
